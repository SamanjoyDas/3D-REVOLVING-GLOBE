# 3D-REVOLVING-GLOBE

IN THIS PROJECT MODULE WE WILL A CREATING A 3D REVOLVING EARTH JUST BY USING HTML AND CSS. THE STEPS TO CREATE IT AS FOLLOWS :-
1) OPEN VS CODE.
2) COPY THE EXACT SAME HTML FILE AND CSS FILE.
3) SAVE AND CLICK ON THE GO LIVE EXTENSION ON THE BOTTOM RIGHT CORNER OF THE SCREEN.

A NEW BROWSER WINDOW WITH OUR DESIRED OUTPUT WILL APPEAR. YOU DON'T NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE WORKING OF THE LINK PRESENT IN THE CSS FILE. IT WILL TAKE SOME TIME TIME TO RENDER. WAIT DURING THAT PERIOD AND ENJOY!
